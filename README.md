# NYT React Search App

NYT-React is an article search and scraping application built with 
**[React] (https://reactjs.org)**, [MongoDB] (https://www.mongodb.com), [Express] (https://expressjs.com), and [Node] (https://nodejs.org). A search for an article executes an AJAX request to the NY Times API to display a result of articles based on user input.

User may search for an article and get a list of results based on search.  The user may choose how many articles to retrieve and specify a date range from when to pull articles.  The user sees article results load immediately and has the option to save or delete an article.  If an article is saved, it will display under 'Saved Articles,' and notification is made if it was successful or unsuccessful.  If an article is deleted, the page updates in real-time.  All unidentified url requests re-directed to the home page.

# NYT React Search App

NYT-React is an article search and scraping application built with 
**[React] (https://reactjs.org)**, [MongoDB] (https://www.mongodb.com), [Express] (https://expressjs.com), and [Node] (https://nodejs.org). A search for an article executes an AJAX request to the NY Times API to display a result of articles based on user input.

User Stories
I can search for an article and get a list of results based on my search.
I can choose how many articles I want to retrieve.
I can specify a date range of when to pull articles from.
Once I make a search I can see article results load right away.
I have the choice to save an article.
If I save an article it will show up when I navigate to the 'Saved Articles' page.
If I try to save an article I will be notified if it was successful or not.
When I view all the saved articles I have the option to delete an article.
If I delete an article I will see the page update, and the article disappear.
If I go to a page that does not exist I will get re-directed to the home page.
